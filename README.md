# Mechanism

It is necessary to add the xchart library below or error will be received
We used the graphic print library whose homework is the java's library xchart
konvul_odev file odevin netbeans project
According to the user's request, GirisTab.java
file prints x and h chart in separate place
But the Convulsion method in the konvul_odev.java file does all the operations.
doing convolution and printing the graph of h [n] and x [n] and y [n]
is printing the graph, the result ...


There are 1 and 2 options in the program I wrote
These;
2) Press 2 for Discrete Time Signals of X [n] and H [n] Graphics (Input) ...
If you press option 2 it shows X and H graphs and asks User to enter values
and asks if X is H or not
1) Press 1 for Discrete Time Signal of Y [n] Graph (Result) ...
Eğer1. If you press the option, it will take values ​​from you and take the convulsion according to these values ​​and
Shows the Y chart


Homework complete in Konvul_Odev.java file
